		Time Will Tell is a 2D-Platformer/RPG about the far future. In this far future,
		all of humanity is ensalaved, and the only person who can save humanity is quite
		possibly the least qualified person for the job. He isn't even a person, since all
		of humanity was already enslaved!
		<br><br><br>
		But none of this matters, because this game is actually about a caveman named Simon,
		and it is set in the Stone Age!
